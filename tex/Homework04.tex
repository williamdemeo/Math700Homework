%% Notes: 
%%    1. Write your answers inside a \begin{solution}...\end{solution} environment.
%%
%%    2. If you will use references, insert bibtex reference entries in the file
%%       Math700.bib.  (Create that file if it doesn't yet exist.)
%%
%%    3. If you will use acronyms, please define them in the macros.tex file.
%%
%%    4. Please try to check that your file compiles:
%%
%%       Mac OS X users: you might try MacTeX. 
%%       Windows users: you might try proTeXt. 
%%       Linux users: most come with TeX; otherwise do a full install of TeXLive.
%%
%%       There is a Makefile in this directory, so on Linux you could just 
%%       enter `make` to compile all the Homework*.tex files at once.
%%
%%    5. Please don't hesitate to inform the prof if you have trouble, or open
%%       a ``New issue'' or create a new ``Wiki page'' on GitHub.  Otherwise,
%%       send an email to williamdemeo@gmail.com.
%%
%%    6. It will probably be hard to keep everyone's notation consistent.
%%       For the most basic symbols, we should have some conventions and use
%%       LaTeX macros to keep the conventions consistent and easy to remember.
%%       For example, to denote an algebra,
         \newcommand\alg[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbf{#1}}}
         \newcommand{\<}{\ensuremath{\langle}}
         \renewcommand{\>}{\ensuremath{\rangle}}
%%       So, an algebra in LaTeX is typed as $\alg{A} = \<A, F\>$.
%%       Similarly, for a field, let's use:
         \newcommand\fld[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbb{#1}}}
%%       So, a field in LaTeX is typed as $\fld{F}$.
%%       Example: We denote the integers by \fld{Z}. 
%%                This comes up often enough that it's useful to define
         \newcommand\Z{\fld{Z}}
%%
%%       For the Galois field, we use:
         \newcommand\GF{\ensuremath{\operatorname{GF}}}
%%
%%    7. Replace these names with yours!!!
