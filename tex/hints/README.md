Usually I will post hints either within the assignment itself, or on a
[Wiki page](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math700Homework/wiki/_pages).
However, the wiki pages are not very convenient for writing mathematical
expressions, so occasionally I will put hints in a separate TeX file which will
be stored in this directory.
