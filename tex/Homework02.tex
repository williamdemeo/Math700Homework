\begin{problem}[Golan 56]

Is it possible to define on $\Z/(4)$ the structure of a vector space over
$\GF(2)$ in such a way that the vector addition is the usual addition in
$\Z/(4)$?\\
\\
~[{\it Hints}: Recall that $(n)$ denotes the set $\{\dots, -2n, -n, 0, n, 2n,
  3n, \dots\}$, which we denoted in lecture by $n\Z$.  This is the ideal
  generated by $n$ in the ring $\Z$, but don't worry about that for now. Just
  take $\Z/(n)$ to be the abelian group of integers $\{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1\}$
  with addition modulo $n$.  In lecture, we used $\Z/n\Z$ to denote
  $\Z/(n)$. Use whichever notation you prefer.]

\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}
Assume toward a contradiction that $\Z/(4)$ is a vector space over GF(2), with vector addition defined as the usual modular addition. Then for any $v \in \Z/(4)$,
\begin{eqnarray*}
0 & = & (0)v \\ & = & (1+1)v \\ & = & 1 \cdot v + 1 \cdot v \\ & = & v + v
\end{eqnarray*}
Now, let $v = 3$ to see that $3 + 3 = 2\mod{4} \neq 0$. Thus we have a contradiction. The answer is no, it is not possible with the usual modular vector addition.

\begin{problem}[Golan 60]

Let $V = C(0,1)$. Define an operation $\boxplus$ on $V$ by setting 
$f \boxplus g : x \mapsto \max \{f(x), g(x)\}$.  
Does this operation of vector addition, together with the usual scalar
multiplication make $V$ into a vector space over $\R$?

\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}
We must show that the $\boxplus$ operation is closed in V, that is, $f \boxplus g \in C(0,1)$. We will prove that $f \boxplus g$ is continuous by the "delta-epsilon" method from real analysis. 

Let $\epsilon > 0$. As $f$,$g$ continuous on $(0,1)$, there exist $\delta_f > 0$ and $\delta_g > 0$ such that

$$ |x - x_0| < \delta_f \implies |f(x)-f(x_0)| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$$ $$|x - x_0| < \delta_g \implies |g(x)-g(x_0)| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$$
Let $h(x) = max\{f(x),g(x)\}$. Let $\delta_h = \min\{\delta_f,\delta_g\}$. Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
|x - x_0| < \delta_h & \implies & |h(x) - h(x_0)| \\ & = & \left|\frac{f(x)+g(x)+|f(x)-g(x)|-f(x_0)-g(x_0)-|f(x_0)-g(x_0)|}{2}\right| \\
& \leq & \left|\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{2}\right| + \left|\frac{g(x)-g(x_0)}{2}\right|
+ \left|\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)-(g(x)-g(x_0))}{2}\right| \\
& < & \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \left|\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)-(g(x)-g(x_0))}{2}\right| \\
& < & \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore $f \boxplus g$ is continuous for $x_0 \in (0,1)$, so vector addition is closed in $V$. With the usual scalar multiplication, $V$ is a vector space over $\R$.

\begin{problem}[Golan 63]

Let $V = \{ i \in \Z \mid 0 \leq i < 2^n \}$ for some fixed positive integer
$n$.  Define operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication on $V$ in
such a way as to turn it into a vector space over $\GF(2)$.\\
\\
~[{\it Hints}: Recall that $\GF(2)$ denotes the Galois field with two elements,
  $\{0, 1\}$, with addition mod 2 and the usual multiplication.
  Other than this field, the only restriction given in the
  problem is that $V$ must have $2^n$ elements. Do you know of any sets of this size?]
\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}
Let us define vector addition in a "bitwise xor" fashion such that $v + v = 0$ and $v + w = 1$ for all $v,w \in V, w \neq v$. Furthermore, let us define scalar multiplication in the natural way such that $1\cdot v = v$ and $0\cdot v = 0$.  Then we can see that vector addition is closed as $0,1 \in V$, as well as being associative and commutative. And every $v$ has an additive inverse, namely $v$. Scalar multiplication is also closed in $V$, as the product is always $0 \in V$ or $v \in V$. So $V$ is a vector space over $\GF(2)$.

\begin{problem}[Golan 70]
Show that $\Z$ is not a vector space over any field.
\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}
Let $\fld{F} = \GF(2)$. Assume $\Z$ is a vector space over $\F$. Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
0 & = & 1_Z(1_F + 1_F) \\
  & = & 1_Z(1_{F})+_Z 1_Z(1_F) \\
  & = & 2 
\end{eqnarray*}
But $0 \neq 2$, so $\Z$ is not a vector space over $\GF(2)$. Now let $\F$ be a field with characteristic greater than 2. Assume $\Z$ a vector space over $\F$. Then we know
$$ 1_F + 1_F = 2_F \implies 1_F = \frac{1}{2_F} + \frac{1}{2_F}$$
Therefore
\begin{eqnarray*}
1_Z & = & 1_F(1_Z) \\
	& = & (\frac{1}{2_F} + \frac{1}{2_F})1_Z \\
	& = & \frac{1}{2_F}(1_Z) +_Z \frac{1}{2_F}(1_Z) \\
\end{eqnarray*}
Now let $\frac{1}{2_F}(1_Z) = n \in \Z$.  But there is no element in $n \in \Z$ that satisfies $n + n = 1$. So $\Z$ is not a vector space over any field with characteristic greater than 2. Thus $\Z$ is not a vector space over any field.

\begin{problem}[Golan 76]

Let $V = \R^\R$ and let $W$ be the subset of $V$ containing the constant
function $x\mapsto 0$ and all of those functions $f \in V$ satisfying the
following condition: $f(a) = 0$ for at most finitely many real numbers $a$.  Is
$W$ a subspace of $V$.\\
\\~
[{\it Hint:} It's easy.]
\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}
Let us assume toward a contradiction that $W$ is a subspace of $V$. Let $p(x), g(x), h(x)$ be distinct functions in $W$, such that $p(x) = g(x) + h(x)$ and $g(x) = 0$ for $x = b_0,\dots ,b_l \in \R$ and $h(x) = 0$ for $x = c_0, \dots , c_m \in \R$.  Then $p(x) = 0$ when $g(x) = h(x) = 0$ or when $g(x) = -h(x)$.  The former happens when $b_i = c_j$ for $1 \leq i \leq l, 1 \leq j \leq m$.  We can see this is a finite set of points.  The latter, however, could happen for an infinite number of points (e.g. define $g(x) = -h(x)$ for $x > max(b_l,c_m) \in \R$). In that case, $p(a) = 0$ for an infinitely many real numbers $a$, but it is not the constant function $x \mapsto 0$. So vector addition is not closed and therefore $W$ is not a subspace in $V$.
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Golan 79]

A function $f \in \R^\R$ is \emph{piecewise constant} if and only if it is a
constant function $x \mapsto c$ or there exist 
$a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n$ and 
$c_0 < c_1 < \cdots < c_n$ in $\R$ such that 
\[
f : x \mapsto 
\begin{cases}
  c_0 & \text{ if $x < a_1$,}\\
  c_i & \text{ if $a_i\leq x < a_i$ for $1\leq i < n$,}\\
  c_n & \text{ if $a_n\leq x$.}
\end{cases}
\]
Does the set of all piecewise constant functions form a subspace of the vector
space $\R^\R$ over $\R$?

\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}

Let $W$ denote the set in question. $W$ is clearly a subset of $\R^{\R}$. Let $r \in \R$ and $k_i = rc_i$. Then
\[
rf : x \mapsto 
\begin{cases}
  k_0 & \text{ if $x < a_1$,}\\
  k_i & \text{ if $a_i\leq x < a_i$ for $1\leq i < n$,}\\
  k_n & \text{ if $a_n\leq x$.}
\end{cases}
\]
So $W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.

Let us describe $f(x),g(x) \in W$ using the characteristic function $\chi$:
$$f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n f(a_i)\chi_{[a_i,a_{i+1}]}(x)$$
$$g(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n f(b_i)\chi_{[b_i,b_{i+1}]}(x)$$
Now let $\{z_0,z_1,\dots \}$ be the reordering of $\{a_0,a_1,\dots ,a_n,b_0,b_1,\dots ,b_n\}$. Then we can describe the sum $f(x) + g(x)$ as follows:
$$(f+g)(x) =  \sum_{i=1}^n (f(z_i)+g(z_i))\chi_{[z_i,z_{i+1}]}(x)$$

Thus $f(x) + g(x)$ is a piecewise constant function and so $W$ is closed under vector addition.  Therefore $W$ is a subspace of $\R^{\R}$.
\end{solution}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}[Golan 81]

Let $W$ be the subspace of $V = \GF(2)^5$ consisting of all vectors 
$(a_1, \dots, a_5)$ satisfying $\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i = 0$.  Is $W$ a subspace of $V$?

\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}
(We assume the problem means "subset" not "subspace" in the first line.  Otherwise trivial.)

We know $W$ is a subset of $V$ and $O_V \in V$. Let $x \in V, x = <a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5>$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{5}a_i = 0$. Let $b \in F$. Then 
$$bx = <b(a_1),b(a_2),b(a_3),b(a_4),b(a_5)>$$
And
$$\sum_{i=1}^{5}(ba_i) = b\left(\sum_{i=1}^{5}a_i\right) = b(0) = 0$$
So $W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.

Let $y \in V$, $y = <c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_5>$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{5}c_i = 0$.  Then
$$x+y = <a_1+c_1,a_2+c_2,a_3+c_3,a_4+c_4,a_5+c_5>$$
Now let $d_i = a_i + c_i$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{i=1}^{5}d_i & = & \sum_{i=1}^{5}(a_i + c_i) \\
				  & = & \sum_{i=1}^{5}a_i + \sum_{i=1}^{5}c_i \\
				  & = & 0 + 0 = 0
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore $W$ is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication so it is a subspace.

\begin{problem}[Golan 85]
Let $V = \R^\R$ and let $W$ be the subset of $V$ consisting of all
functions $f$ satisfying the following condition: there exists $c\in \R$
(that depends on $f$) such that $|f(a)|\leq c|a|$ for all $a\in \R$.
Is $W$ a subspace of $V$?

\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}

We know $W$ is a subset of $V$. Let $g(x) \in W$. There exists a $c_1 \in \R$ such that $\forall x \in \R$  $|h(x)| \leq c|x|$.
Let $b \in \R$. Let $h(x) = b(g(x))$. Then

\begin{eqnarray*}
|h(x)| & = & |b(g(x))| \\
	   & \leq & |b| |g(x)| \\
	   & \leq & |b|(c_1|x|) \\
	   & = & c|x|
\end{eqnarray*}
Where $c = |b|c_1$. So $\exists c \in \R$ such that $\forall x \in \R$ we have
$$|h(x)| \leq c|x|$$
Therefore $W$ is closed under scalar multiplication.  

Let $p(x),g(x) \in W$.  There exist $c_1,c_2 \in \R$ such that $\forall x \in \R$
$$|p(x)| \leq c_1|x|$$
$$|q(x)| \leq c_2|x|$$
Let $t(x) = p(x) + g(x)$. Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
t(x) & = & |p(x) + g(x)| \\ 
	 & \leq & |p(x)| + |g(x)| \\
	 & \leq & c_1|x| + c_2|x| \\
	 & = & (c_1+c_2)|x| \\
	 = c_3|x|  
\end{eqnarray*}
where $c_3 = c_1 + c_2$. Therefore $\exists c \in \R$ such that $\forall x \in \R$ we have
$$t(x) \leq c|x|$$
Thus $W$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication so $W$ is a subspace of $V$.

\begin{problem}[Golan 93]

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ and let $P$ be the collection of all
subsets of $V$, which we know is a vector space over $\GF(2)$.  Is the
collection of all subpaces of $V$ a subspace of $P$?

\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}

$P$ is the collection of all subset of $V$. Let $U$ be the collection of all subspaces of $V$. As all subspaces of $V$ must be subsets of $V$, we know that $U \subseteq V$. We want to show that $U$ is a subspace of $P$.

Let $X \in U$. Then $X \in P$. Let $a \in F$. Let $y,z \in X$.  Then $ay, az \in aX$. $ay + az = a(x+y)$.  As $X$ is a subspace, $(x+y) \in X$ so $a(x+y) \in aX$. Thus $aX$ is closed under addition. Let $b \in F$. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
b(ay) & = & (ba)y \\
	  & = & (ab)y \\
	  & = & a(by) \\
\end{eqnarray*}
So $by \in X \implies a(by) \in aX$. $aX is closed under scalar multplication.$ And $X \subseteq V \implies aX \subseteq V$. Then $aX$ is a subspace, so $U$ is closed under scalar multplication.

Let $Y \in U, x \in X, y \in Y$. $X + Y = \fld{F}\{x,y\}$. Let $[,q \in X + Y$ such that for $x_1,x_2 \in X, y_1,y_2 \in Y, a,b \in F$
$$p = ax_1 + by_1$$
$$q = cx_2 + dy_2$$
Now we add $p + q$
\begin{eqnarray}
p + q & = &(ax_1 + by_1) + (cx_2 + dy_2) \\
	  & = &(ax_1 + cx_2) + (by_1 + dy_2) 
\end{eqnarray}
Since we know $(ax_1 + cx_2) \in X$ and $(by_1 + dy_2) \in Y$, we can deduce that $p + q \in X + Y$. Then $U$ is closed under addition.  So $U$ is a subspace of $P$.

\begin{problem}[Golan 105]

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ and let $0_V \neq w \in V$.  Given a
vector $v \in V \setminus Fw$, find the set $G$ of all scalars $a \in F$
satisfying $F\{v, w\} = F\{v, aw\}$.

\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}

$$F\{v,w\} = \{bv + cw | b,c \in \fld{F} \} $$
$$F\{v,aw\} = \{dv + e(aw) | d,e \in \fld{F}\}$$

$F$ is a field, so it is closed under multiplication. $v$ is not a scalar multiple of $w$. We know $1 \in G$. Thus $\fld{F}\{v,aw\} \leq \fld{F}\{v,w\} \forall a \in \fld{F}$. Let $x \in \fld{F}\{v,w\}.$. Then for $s,t \in \fld{F}$

\begin{eqnarray*}
x & = & sv + tw  \\
  & = & sv + \frac{t}{a}(aw) \\
\end{eqnarray*}

So $\frac{t}{a} = ta^-1$, and $t \in \fld{F}, a^-1 \in \fld{F}$ so $ta^-1 \in \fld{F}$ as long as $a \neq 0$. So $G = \fld{F} \backslash 0_V$.
