%%test This is the Homework LaTeX template.  Use this file to fill in your solutions. 
%%
%% Notes: 
%%    1. Write your answers inside a \begin{solution}...\end{solution} environment.
%%
%%    2. If you will use references, insert bibtex reference entries in the file
%%       Math700.bib.  (Create that file if it doesn't yet exist.)
%%
%%    3. If you will use acronyms, please define them in the macros.tex file.
%%
%%    4. Please try to check that your file compiles:
%%
%%       Mac OS X users: you might try MacTeX. 
%%       Windows users: you might try proTeXt. 
%%       Linux users: most come with TeX; otherwise do a full install of TeXLive.
%%
%%       There is a Makefile in this directory, so on Linux you could just 
%%       enter `make` to compile all the Homework*.tex files at once.
%%
%%    5. Please don't hesitate to inform the prof if you have trouble, or open
%%       a ``New issue'' or create a new ``Wiki page'' on GitHub.  Otherwise,
%%       send an email to williamdemeo@gmail.com.
%%
%%    6. It will probably be hard to keep everyone's notation consistent.
%%       For the most basic symbols, we should have some conventions and use
%%       LaTeX macros to keep the conventions consistent and easy to remember.
%%       For example, to denote an algebra,
         \newcommand\alg[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbf{#1}}}
         \newcommand{\<}{\ensuremath{\langle}}
         \renewcommand{\>}{\ensuremath{\rangle}}
%%       So, an algebra in LaTeX is typed as $\alg{A} = \<A, F\>$.
%%       Similarly, for a field, let's use:
         \newcommand\fld[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbb{#1}}}
%%       So, a field in LaTeX is typed as $\fld{F}$.
%%       Example: We denote the integers by \fld{Z}. 
%%                This comes up often enough that it's useful to define
         \newcommand\Z{\fld{Z}}
%%
%%       For the Galois field, we use:
         \newcommand\GF{\ensuremath{\operatorname{GF}}}
%%
%%    7. Replace these names with yours!!!

\begin{problem}[Golan 307]
Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ and let $W$ be a subspace of $V$.  
For each $v \in V$, let $v + W = \{v+w \mid w \in W\}$.  Let 
$V/W = \{v+W \mid v \in V\}$ be the collection of all sets of the form $v+W$,
and define operations of addition and scalar multiplication on $V/W$ by 
setting $(v+W) + (v'+W) = (v+v')+W$ and $c(v+W) = (cv)+W$ for all $v, v' \in V$
and $c\in F$.  Show that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $v+W = v'+W$ if and only if $v-v'\in W$;
\item $V/W$, with the given operations, is a vector space over $F$;
\item The function $v\mapsto v+W$ is an epimorphism from $V$ to $W$,
the kernel of which equals $W$;
\item Every complement of $W$ in $V$ is isomorphic to $V/W$;
\item If $(v+W)\cap (v'+W) \neq \emptyset$, then $v+W = v'+W$.
\end{enumerate}
The space $V/W$ is called the \emph{factor space} of $V$ by $W$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\item Let $v+W = v'+W$.

Let $\alpha \in \Aut(\R^2)$ be defined by 
$\alpha: 
\begin{bmatrix} a\\ b \end{bmatrix} 
\mapsto 
\begin{bmatrix} -b\\ a \end{bmatrix}$.
Show that $\R\{\alpha, \sigma_1\}$ is a unital subalgebra of $\End(\R^2)$.  Show
that it is proper by giving an example of an endomorphism of $\R^2$ not in this

more than one element then it is infinite.
