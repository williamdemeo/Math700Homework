%%    6. It will probably be hard to keep everyone's notation consistent.
%%       For the most basic symbols, we should have some conventions and use
%%       LaTeX macros to keep the conventions consistent and easy to remember.
%%       For example, to denote an algebra,
         \newcommand\alg[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbf{#1}}}
         \newcommand{\<}{\ensuremath{\langle}}
         \renewcommand{\>}{\ensuremath{\rangle}}
%%       So, an algebra in LaTeX is typed as $\alg{A} = \<A, F\>$.
%%       Similarly, for a field, let's use:
         \newcommand\fld[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbb{#1}}}
%%       So, a field in LaTeX is typed as $\fld{F}$.
%%       Example: We denote the integers by \fld{Z}. 
%%                This comes up often enough that it's useful to define
         \newcommand\Z{\fld{Z}}
%%
%%       For the Galois field, we use:
         \newcommand\GF{\ensuremath{\operatorname{GF}}}
%%
%%    7. Replace these names with yours!!!

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ and let $W$ be a subspace of $V$.  
For each $v \in V$, let $v + W = \{v+w \mid w \in W\}$.  Let 
$V/W = \{v+W \mid v \in V\}$ be the collection of all sets of the form $v+W$,
and define operations of addition and scalar multiplication on $V/W$ by

and $c\in F$.  Show that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $v+W = v'+W$ if and only if $v-v'\in W$;
\item $V/W$, with the given operations, is a vector space over $F$;

\begin{solution}

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ and let $W$ be a subspace of $V$.
For each $v \in V$, let $v + W = \{v+w \mid w \in W\}$. Let
$V/W = \{v+W \mid v \in V\}$ be the collection of all sets of the form $v+W$,
and define operations of addition and scalar multiplication on $V/W$ by
setting $(v+W) + (v'+W) = (v+v')+W$ and $c(v+W) = (cv)+W$ for all $v, v' \in V$
and $c\in F$. Show that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $v+W = v'+W$ if and only if $v-v'\in W$;
\item $V/W$, with the given operations, is a vector space over $F$;
\item The function $v\mapsto v+W$ is an epimorphism from $V$ to $W$,
the kernel of which equals $W$;
\item Every complement of $W$ in $V$ is isomorphic to $V/W$;
\item If $(v+W)\cap (v'+W) \neq \emptyset$, then $v+W = v'+W$.
\end{enumerate}
The space $V/W$ is called the \emph{factor space} of $V$ by $W$.
\smallskip

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $v + W = v' + W$ for some $v, v' \in V$. Then $v = v + 0_W = v' + w$ 
for some $w \in W$, so that $v - v' = w \in W$.
\smallskip
Now let $v - v' \in W$. Then $v - v' = w'$ for some $w' \in W$, so that for 
any $w \in W$ we have $v + w = (v' + w') + w = v' + (w' + w) \in v'+W$, which 
shows $v + W \in v' + W$. Due to symmetry, we must also have $v'+ W \in v + W$. 
Hence $v + W = v' + W$.
\item First, let's check that the given operations are well-defined, i.e. if 
$u + W = v + W$ for some $u,v \in W$ and $u' + W = v' + W$ for some $u',v' \in W$, 
then $(u + u') + W = (v + v') + W$ and $cu + W = cv + W$ for all $c \in F$.
\smallskip
If $u + W = v + W$ and $u' + W = v' + W$ for some $u,v,u',v' \in W$, then, by 1), 
$u - v = w$ and $u' - v' = w'$ for some $w, w' \in W$. So $(u + u') - (v + v') = w + w' \in W$,
and, using 1), we get $(u + u') + W = (v + v') + W$. Also, $cu - cv = c(u - v) = cw \in W$, 
so that $cu + W = cv + W$, by 1) as well. Thus, the given operations are indeed well-defined.
\smallskip
To show $V/W$, with the given operations, is a vector space, we first need to prove $V/W$ 
is an abelian group.
\smallskip
Let $u + W, u_1 + W, u_2 + W, u_3 + W \in V/W$. Then 
$((u_1 + W) + (u_2 + W)) + (u_3 + W) = ((u_1 + u_2) + W) + (u_3 + W) = 
((u_1 + u_2) + u_3) + W = (u_1 + (u_2 + u_3)) + W = (u_1 + W) + ((u_2 + u_3) + W) = 
(u_1 + W) + ((u_2 + W) + (u_3 + W))$, so the sum operation in $V/W$ is associative. 
Also, $(0 + W) + (u + W) = (0 + u) + W = u + W = (u + 0) + W = (u + W) + (0 + W)$, 
so $0 + W$ is an identity element in $(V/W,+)$. 
Finally, $(-u + W) + (u + W) = (-u + u) + W = 0 + W$, which shows $-u + W$ is an inverse 
for $u + W$. Hence $V/W$, with the given addition operation, is a group. 
Since $(u_1 + W) + (u_2 + W) = (u_1 + u_2) + W = (u_2 + u_1) + W = (u_2 + W) + (u_1 + W)$, then it is abelian.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}[Golan 338]
Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ which is not finitely generated, and
let $\sigma_0 \neq \alpha \in \End(V)$.  Set 
$A = \{\beta \in \End(V) \mid \alpha \beta = \sigma_1\}$.  Show that if $A$ has
more than one element then it is infinite.
\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}

Suppose $A$ has two elements, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. Then there exists a basis 
vector $v$ of $V$ such that $\beta_1(v) \ne \beta_2(v)$. For $n \ge 3$, define 
$\beta_n \in \End(V)$ via $\beta_n(v)=(n-1)\beta_1(v)-(n-2)\beta_2(v)$ and 
$\beta_n(u)=\beta_1(u)$, where $u$ is a basis vector of $\V$ such that $u \ne v$. 
Then $\alpha\beta_n(v)=(n-1)\alpha\beta_1(v)-(n-2)\alpha\beta_2(v)=(n-1)v-(n-2)v=v$ 
and $\alpha\beta_n(u)=\alpha\beta_1(u)=u$ for a basis vector $u$ of $V$ such that 
$u \ne v$. Thus, $\beta_n \in A$ for all $n$. 
For $n \ne k$, $\beta_n(v)-\beta_k(v)=(n-k)(\beta_1(v)-\beta_2(v)) \ne 0$, which 
shows $\beta_n \ne \beta_k$ for $n \ne k$. Hence $A$ contains infinitely many elements.

\begin{problem}[Golan 340]
Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$ satisfying the condition that
$\alpha\beta = \beta\alpha$ for all $\alpha, \beta \in \End(V)$. Show that
$\dim{V} = 1$.
\end{problem}
\smallskip
\begin{solution}

Suppose $\dim{V}>1$. Then there exist two linearly independent vectors $e_1$ and 
$e_2$ in $V$. Define $\alpha \in \End(V)$ via $\alpha(e_1)=e_2$ and $\alpha(v)=0$ 
if $v \notin span(e_1)$. Define $\beta \in \End(V)$ via $\beta(e_2)=e_1$ and 
$\beta(v)=0$ if $v \notin span(e_2)$. Then $\alpha\beta(e_1)=\alpha(0)=0$, which 
does not equal $\beta\alpha(e_1)=\beta(e_2)=e_1$, a contradiction.
