%% Notes: 
%%    1. Write your answers inside a \begin{solution}...\end{solution} environment.
%%
%%    2. If you will use references, insert bibtex reference entries in the file
%%       Math700.bib.  (Create that file if it doesn't yet exist.)
%%
%%    3. If you will use acronyms, please define them in the macros.tex file.
%%
%%    4. Please try to check that your file compiles:
%%
%%       Mac OS X users: you might try MacTeX. 
%%       Windows users: you might try proTeXt. 
%%       Linux users: most come with TeX; otherwise do a full install of TeXLive.
%%
%%       There is a Makefile in this directory, so on Linux you could just 
%%       enter `make` to compile all the Homework*.tex files at once.
%%
%%    5. Please don't hesitate to inform the prof if you have trouble, or open
%%       a ``New issue'' or create a new ``Wiki page'' on GitHub.  Otherwise,
%%       send an email to williamdemeo@gmail.com.
%%
%%    6. It will probably be hard to keep everyone's notation consistent.
%%       For the most basic symbols, we should have some conventions and use
%%       LaTeX macros to keep the conventions consistent and easy to remember.
%%       For example, to denote an algebra,
         \newcommand\alg[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbf{#1}}}
         \newcommand{\<}{\ensuremath{\langle}}
         \renewcommand{\>}{\ensuremath{\rangle}}
%%       So, an algebra in LaTeX is typed as $\alg{A} = \<A, F\>$.
%%       Similarly, for a field, let's use:
         \newcommand\fld[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbb{#1}}}
%%       So, a field in LaTeX is typed as $\fld{F}$.
%%       Example: We denote the integers, and the real, complex, and rational 
%%                numbers by \fld{Z}, \fld{R}, \fld{C}, \fld{Q}. 
%%                These come up often enough that it's useful to define
         \newcommand\Z{\fld{Z}}
         \newcommand\R{\fld{R}}
         \newcommand\C{\fld{C}}
         \newcommand\Q{\fld{Q}}
         % The natural numbers do not comprise a field, but we still use:
         \newcommand\N{\fld{N}}
%%
%%       For the Galois field, we use:
         \newcommand\GF{\ensuremath{\operatorname{GF}}}
%%
%%    7. Replace these names with yours:
         \metadata{Your first names go here}{Homework 3 -- 2014/03/05}
         \author{Your full names go here}

Let $F$ be a field and let $(K, \bullet)$ be an associative unital
$F$-algebra.  If $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $K$, we let $A\bullet B$ be the set
of all elements of $K$ of the form $a \bullet b$, with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$
(in particular, $\emptyset \bullet B = A \bullet \emptyset = \emptyset$).
We know that the set $V$ of all subsets of $K$ is a vector space over $\GF(2)$.
Is $(V, \bullet)$ a $\GF(2)$-algebra?  If so, is it associative?  Is it unital?

\noindent {\bf Clarification/amplification of Props 5.12 and 5.13.} 
Let $V$ be a vector space, and let
$\{W_\omega : \omega \in \Omega\}$ be a collection of subspaces of $V$.
Recall that $\sum_{\omega \in \Omega}W_\omega$ denotes the subspace of all
(finite) linear combinations of vectors in $\{W_\omega : \omega \in \Omega\}$,
which is equivalent to the subspace of vectors $w$ of the form
$w = \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda}w_\lambda$, where $w_\lambda \in W_\lambda$ and
$\Lambda$ is a finite subset of $\Omega$.

We call the set $\{W_\omega : \omega \in \Omega\}$ \emph{independent} if and
only if it satisfies the following condition:
If $\Lambda$ is a finite subset of $\Omega$, if $w_\lambda \in W_\lambda$ for
each $\lambda \in \Lambda$, and if $\sum_{\lambda\in \Lambda} w_\lambda = 0_V$,
then $w_\lambda = 0_V$ for all $\lambda \in \Lambda$.


\begin{problem}
Let 
\[W_1 = \left\{\begin{bmatrix}  a \\ 0\end{bmatrix} : a\in \R \right\},  \;
W_2 = \left\{\begin{bmatrix}  b \\ b\end{bmatrix} : b\in \R\right\}, \; 
W_3 = \left\{\begin{bmatrix}  0 \\ c\end{bmatrix} : a\in \R\right\}.
\]  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Would our textbook author describe $\{W_1, W_2, W_3\}$ as ``pairwise disjoint?'' (explain)
%% That is, do we have $W_i \cap W_j = \left\{\begin{bmatrix}  0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \right\}$ for each pair $i\neq j$ in $\{1,2,3\}$.  
\item 
Describe the space $W_1 + W_2 + W_3$.
\item Describe the space $W_i + W_j$ for each pair $i\neq j$ in $\{1,2,3\}$.  
\item Is the set $\{W_1, W_2, W_3\}$ independent?

\begin{problem}
Below is an alleged theorem that attempts to combine Propositions 5.12 and 5.13
of the textbook.  Prove it, or disprove it by providing a counterexample.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{prop}
Suppose $\{W_\omega : \omega \in \Omega\}$ is a collection of subspaces of a vector
space, and suppose, for each $\omega \in \Omega$, the set $B_\omega$ is a
basis for $W_\omega$.  Then the following are equivalent: \\[-0.5em]
\begin{enumerate}
\item The set $\{W_\omega : \omega \in \Omega\}$ is independent.\\[-0.5em]
\item Every $w \in \sum_{\omega \in \Omega}W_\omega$ can be written as 
$w  = \sum_{\lambda \in \Lambda}w_\lambda$ in exactly one way.\\[-0.5em]
% (Here $\Lambda$ is a finite subset of $\Omega$.)
\item For every $\lambda \in \Omega$, 
$W_\lambda \cap \sum_{\omega \neq\lambda}W_\omega = \{0_V\}$.\\[-0.5em]
\item The set $B = \bigcup_{\omega \in \Omega} B_\omega$ is a basis for 
$\sum_{\omega \in \Omega}W_\omega$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\smallskip

(type your proof or counterexample here)
\end{problem}

\noindent {\it Final remark.} We use 
% $\bigoplus \{W_\omega : \omega \in \Omega\}$ or
$\bigoplus_{\omega \in \Omega} W_\omega$ to denote 
$\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} W_\omega$ \emph{only when} the set
$\{W_\omega : \omega \in \Omega\}$ is independent.  
When I mentioned this in class, instead of \emph{only when}, I used
the phrase \emph{when and only when}. This is incorrect since the expression
$\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} W_\omega$ does not necessarily imply that the set
$\{W_\omega : \omega \in \Omega\}$ is dependent.
