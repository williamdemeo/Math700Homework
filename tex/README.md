# LaTeX files

In this directory are the LaTeX files containing the homework assignments, and
solutions that have been typeset, submitted, and curated by the students.

If you have questions about compiling the .tex files to create pdf documents,
please ask someone: email the prof, or post a question on the
[Wiki pages](https://github.com/williamdemeo/Math700Homework/wiki/_pages).

Feel free to edit this README.md page and add News/Status items below.  

(Tip: remember to end your entry with two blank spaces as this will produce a newline.)
